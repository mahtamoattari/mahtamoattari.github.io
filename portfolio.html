      <h2>Interad</h2>
        <p class="fsize">At Interad we work on different projects to prepare sufficient apps/websites for users to help them through the process of their financial matters, online and with no or with minimal help from the financial institute like bank, etc.. 

        Our apps address problems like saving up, getting mortgage, getting pre-qualification for mortgage, finding your ideal home and buying your home.

        Our main focus is user satisfaction and we try to achieve that by including user experience process in every step of our design process.  </p>

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>We usually start with defining our target (users) and the problem that we are aiming to solve for them. Then we use persona and story board to get a deeper understanding, and come up with potential solution(s). After that, we try to improve our solution from different perspective by having discussions and defining the user and system flows. Next step is designing wireframe to be able to discuss the solution in more depth with more details, as well as do some user testing.
        
        </div><!-- /.col-lg-2 -->
         <div class="col-lg-2">
             <h3></h3> 
             We go through any of the above stages as many times as we need, to get the desired result. 
        The final stage is to create mock-ups and then develop the idea. But that is not the end of the process. We always look for user feedback and constant improvement in our products, even after the development is done.

          <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>The tools that we use vary based on the needs of the projects. I’ve been using, pen and paper, Photoshop, Illustrator, Axure and Invision within most projects. In order to create style guide and communicate the ideas between creative team and the team of our developers and QA we’ve started to use a new, easy to use, and powerful application called Zeplin. In creative team we share our work with the rest of the team through Google Drive to keep everything in order, up to date, and accessible for everyone in team. </p>

          <h3>Tasks</h3>
        <p>Designing wireframe, user testing sessions and create mock-ups. Obviously user testing is an important part of the process, which gives us a better idea of how the target user will interact with the system that we are trying to build and where are the pain points and possibly how can we resolve those.
