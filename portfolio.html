      <h2>Interad</h2>
        <p class="fsize">At Interad, we work on different projects to develop online applications for users that will help them fulfill their financial needs with little or no help from financial institutions. Our apps address problems like saving up, getting mortgage, getting pre-qualification for mortgage, finding your ideal home and buying your home. Our main focus is user satisfaction, and we try to achieve that by including user experience concepts in every step of our design process.

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>We usually start by determining our end-users and the problem that we are aiming to solve for them. Next, we use persona and storyboard to get a deeper understanding of their problem, and then come up with potential solution(s). Afterwards, we try to improve our solution from different perspective by having discussions and defining the user and system flows. In order to achieve this, we design a wireframe to be able to discuss the solution in details, as well as perform some user testing.        
        </div><!-- /.col-lg-2 -->
         <div class="col-lg-2">
             <h3></h3> 
             We usually go through any of the above stages as many times as needed, to get the desired result. Finally, we create mock-ups and then develop the idea. This process does not end at this point. We always request for feedback from our end-users to help us constantly improve our products, even after the development is done.

          <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>The tools that we use vary based on the needs of the projects. Iâ€™ve been using, pen and paper, Photoshop, Illustrator, Axure and Invision for most projects. In order to create style guides and communicate the ideas between our creative team and the team of our developers and QA, we have started using a new, easy to use, and powerful application called Zeplin. In our creative team, we share our work with the rest of the team through Google Drive to keep everything in order, up to date, and accessible to everyone in team. </p>

          <h3>Tasks</h3>
        <p>Designing wireframe, user testing sessions and creating mock-ups. User testing has been an important part of our process because it gives us a better idea of how the target user will interact with the system that we are trying to build, identify where the pain points are, and possibly determine how we can resolve them.
